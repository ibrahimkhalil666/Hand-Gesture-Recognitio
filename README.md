# Hand Gesture Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for a deep learning model implemented in TensorFlow/Keras for recognizing hand gestures from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Overview

Hand gesture recognition is an important task in computer vision with various applications such as sign language recognition, gesture-based interaction systems, and more. In this project, we train a CNN model to classify hand gestures into different categories, including palm, thumb, fist, and others.

## Dataset

We used the "leapGestRecog" dataset for training and testing our model. The dataset consists of images of hand gestures captured using Leap Motion Controller. It contains 10 classes of hand gestures, each with 2000 images.
